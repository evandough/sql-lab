# SQL Murder Mystery Project

This project is based off of [sql-mysteries](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries?tab=readme-ov-file#sql-murder-mystery) GitHub. This project is to understand SQL concepts and commands. 

## Goals
Main objective is to solve the case and keep SQL City safe. 

## What You'll Find Here ðŸ‘“
I'll have the queries that were ran, the thought process behind the queries, and notes of what the queries do to solve this mystery. 

## Lessons Learned
This was a fun project. Studying for certificates **KQL** has popped up, but this was my first time actually playing around with **SQL**. **Structured Query Language (SQL)** is the language to talk to the database - it's love language if you will. It was nice to start small and then ramp things up by figuring out how to grab more data and filter that data. The Schema Diagram helped out tremendously by being able to see the primary key and how it was connected.

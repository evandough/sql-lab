# SQL Labs

This repository is a collection of **SQL** projects that reflect my journey in learning advanced querying techniques and documenting the journey â€” one case at a time.

## What You'll Find Here

Each folder represents a focused mini-project or set of queries tied to a task.
This repo is a collection of:
- Walkthroughs and solutions to SQL-based games 
- Tips and SQL tricks I learn along the way
- Notes and breakdowns of how I approach each problem
- Queries with commentary, not just answers

It's part blog, part notebook, part playground.

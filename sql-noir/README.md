## Goals
Main objective is to solve the various crimes using **SQL**. SQL Noir is an interactive mystery-solving game where you crack cases by writing SQL queries.

## What You'll Find Here üïµÔ∏è
I'll have the queries that were ran for each case, the thought process behind the queries, and notes of what the queries do to solve this mystery. 

| Folder | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| `vanishing-briefcase/` | Recover the briefcase and find the suspect. |
| `stolen-sound/` | A prized vinyl record has been stolen - time to find the suspect. |

## Lessons Learned
This was a fun project. Studying for Microsoft certificates **KQL** has popped up, but this was my first time actually playing around and getting hands-on experience with **SQL**. **Structured Query Language (SQL)** is the language to talk to the database - it's love language if you will.
